## Project set up
composer install

## Kindly note some of the NavBar links not redirecting to any pages, they were just for testing how the navbar comes out

## Some of the were not yet covered which include:
testing modal popup on hover
testing autocomplete on movie search functionality
adding pagination links
restricting user from adding movies to favourites if not loggedin

## Also kindly note I had to use static image on all movies because the API is giving 404 error on all images that is poster_path
